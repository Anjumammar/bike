In recent days, Pubic rental bike sharing is becoming popular because of is increased comfortableness and environmental sustainability. Dataset used include per hour demand of Rented bike in  Seoul . dataset contain weather data associated with it for each hour.  we had applied , four  Regression models with optimized hyperparameters using a repeated cross validation approach and testing set is used for evaluation: (a) Linear regression  (b) Random Forest Regression (c) XG Boot Regression  (d) GBM (e) . Multiple evaluation indices such as R2, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error  were used to measure the prediction performance of the regression models. The results show that the XG Boost  was able to explain about 96 and 87% of the Variance (R2) in the training and  testing set of Seoul Bike data respectively. An analysis with variable importance was carried to analyse the most significant variables for all the models developed with the  dataset considered. The variable importance results have shown that Functioning Day , Rainfall ,Seasons and Temperature of the day are the most influential variables in the hourly rental bike demand prediction.
